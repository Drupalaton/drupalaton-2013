<p>With Walkthrough.it you can add a documentation layer on top of your website. You can play tutorials that guide people through your site, step by step. It's like a GPS for your website. And the best part is: you can use community tutorials and easily share and collaborate on common scenarios.</p>
<p>In this session you will learn how you can record Walkthrough tutorials using Selenium IDE, an open source plugin for Firefox. How you can then edit them, share them and incorporate them into your website.</p>

<p>During the presentation the audience will find out about:<br />
main features of Apache Stanbol and its integration with Drupal</p>
<ul>
<li>how to discover and use custom/domain specific Linked Data datasets with Apache Stanbol/Drupal</li>
<li>how to build an advanced semantic processing chain in Apache Stanbol that will automatically annotate Drupal entities</li>
<li>how to implement a content recommendation/reasoning feature for Drupal based on Apache Stanbol services.</li>

<p>Apache Stanbol is an Open Source software stack designed to provide a powerful semantic engine via RESTful services returning results as RDF (Resource Description Language) and JSON. Unlike existing proprietary, commmerically oriented solutions such as OpenCalais, Apache Stanbol is highly customizable and may be trained to provide semantic services for virtually any language.</p>

<p>This presentation will show how to adjust your thinking and some processes when using Sass and Compass to maximize long-term efficiency and minimize the time it takes to reconnect with the project after a period of inactivity or for a new themer to get into the project details.</p>
<p>This presentation is focused on introductory concepts of how to approach coding with Sass efficiently, but it doesn't explain the basic Sass syntax, how to install and configure Sass and Compass nor how they are used in particular Drupal themes.</p>
<p>Even though knowledge of basic Sass concepts is useful it isn't required to follow the presentation. A lot of insights about coding CSS efficiently can be gained even by those who don't have any Sass experience, and they can also use this presentation as a research about Sass, whether it could bring benefits to their work and whether they would like to learn more about it.</p>

<p>The power of Drupal comes from the lego-like capability of, which makes it possible to build really fancy results within a short time. In the first part of the projects mostly we’ll face with a very smiley customer, with a fast growing level of trust. When it comes to refine the rugged surface of the project, the smiley will evaporate with the missed deadline, and the suddenly overgrown project scope…</p>
<p>Using Agile Development contracting and working methods, we can manage the classical problem of the time/cost/scope triangle. In the last years we designed and implemented many successful B2B projects using scrum. We have realized that besides the PM method, it is crutial to grow and sustain a trustful environment within the team, and with the customers. Trust is a catalyst. If there is trust, we have everything we need to work efficiently, to have great results, moreover to keep the well-being of our employees and clients.</p>
<p>But what are the pillars of building trust?</p>
<p>In my presentation I would like to present this approach via real life examples. I’ll show you a working model about building trust by using agile techniques and of course, well, with Drupal.</p>

Most of the development (even core development) happens against the developer's personal free time or his paid hours. Because of this many issues, fixes and changes are pushed back and fixed when the developer can steal away some of his time.</p>
<p>We have asked ourselves a question: What everything could be achieved, if we'd find a way how the community could contribute financially to the Drupal development? There are over 970 000+ registered users on Drupal.org. If only 1% of us would donate 1% of our salary each month, we would rise over $5M/year - enough to feed around 100 full time developers.</p>
<p>With these numbers in your mind - think about Drupal 8 issues, modules that will need to be ported to Drupal 8; that missing part of Drupal Commerce or Open Atrium; changes &amp; new features to Drupal.org. Or think about the plans you could have to create a curriculum to teach Drupal at a local university, to write a book on Drupal development, or prepare a stellar marketing materials. Or you would like to sponsor a code sprint for some of the many Drupal 8 initiatives… How much could we all as individuals and companies benefit if we together supported the development and not only depend on volunteering time.</p>
<p>Drupalfund.us is a crowdfunding platform for projects related to Drupal (aka Kickstarter for Drupal). It can be used to support both coding and non-coding projects. Submit a project idea, get valuable feedback from the community, raise funds and deliver your project. It’s goal is to provide an easy way how our community could contribute to the Drupal development. Launching: July 30, 2013</p>
<p>In this session I would like to present the basic idea of crowdfunding approach to Drupal development, explain how Drupalfund works, encourage attendees to submit a project and listen to the community feedback.</p>
<p>Can crowdfunding be a new way to achieve greatness in Drupal development?</p>
<p>Let's be very clear from the beginning: We absolutely love Drupal, its community, and honour the wonderful yet hard work that we all do to support Drupal!</p>

Drupal gives us everything to follow this path. High-quality contributed modules, the development framework through both the contrib space and Drupal core itself, and the extremely helpful community behind this technology are all leading to success.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-speaker-session-summary">        <div class="field-content"><p>Once upon a time there were Netscape Composer and FTP. Then came Adobe Dreamweaver and CVS. Now you are working with Drupal and Git...</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered during the session, giving, hopefully, comforting answers to these questions:<br />
- How can we safely deploy various data (code, configuration and content) to different environments using tools like Git, Features, Feeds, etc.?<br />
- What solutions are known to handle development/staging/production environments well, so that you will not be braindead after a deploy?<br />
- What questions can be raised about a project with one developer working in the ivory tower?<br />
- What questions can be raised about a project with multiple developers in the bazaar? i.e. how to handle conflicts without headache?<br />
- How can different versions of the same Drupal 7 site be managed in a trackable, reasonable and feasible way in the midst of 2013?<br />
- What are the bigger areas of such development that needs your attention, and what tools are available?</p>
<p>Being involved in Drupal development is a passion. A passion of coding, finding bugs, thinking about the workflow - and since all of these are constantly changing, the best way to keep up with the rest of the world is being part of it. As a lead developer, I am at least partially responsible for the overall client satisfaction - but for the satisfaction of my fellow developers as well. While one can use Drupal as a one-man-business, and may even be successful with this approach, it seems there is not a single person having all the talents that even a moderately big website needs. This is the point when we do have to work in a team.</p>
<p>Working in a team may be frustrating, especially if one comes from the world of an ivory tower using proprietary software. Working with Drupal is more close to the bazaar model: we have so many building blocks (call them modules, themes, jQuery plugins and whatsoever) that we cannot even know all of them, at least not as a single person. Part of the frustration may come from the unfamiliar workflow of a team that shares the work. Drupal is not only scalable by the means of web server load, but also scalable by development manpower. By the way, is there any other web tool with more than a hundred thousand developers, eagerly waiting for your issues to be solved? ;)</p>
<p>I was sucked in by this enthusiastic attitude of the Drupal community. We, as a company, are trying to utilize this wonderful experience - not only in-house, but also as a part of international and local Drupal communities. This continuous integration of the whole Drupal community is such an experience that allows me to sleep well, since about 9 out of 10 Drupal-related questions that I submit to Google are already answered. I want to share this knowledge with you, especially about the workflow we are following that allows even my boss to sleep well.</p>
<p>...so you will continue to develop happily ever after.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-speaker-session-summary">        <div class="field-content"><p>There are many cases where constraints and limitations make decision making process hard. In this presentation we will deal with a typical problem that many organizations need to address - optimizing funds distribution according to a set of rules including votes from decision makers. To help them overcome this problem Drupal is used to build a solution that handles reviewing proposals (about how to spend funds), recording votes and computing the best fitting solution.</p>
<p>Data is handled using Drupal Views and standard content types while voting is done using fivestar voting system. Discrete optimization algorithm methods are used to calculate funds distribution to satisfy geo-location and categories percentage constraints, overall budget amount constraints and votes. We will also see what the basic concepts of discrete optimization method are, what kind of problems it can solve and how it can be integrated into Drupal.</p>

There are just too many screen sizes to deal with manually, and content reuse is becoming more and more mainstream. So far 2 key trends have been gaining momentum for mobile publishing: responsive design and adaptive content. In this presentation, you'll learn about both techniques and how they complement each other. I'll then demonstrate how to build a multi-platform content strategy with these techniques using existing free open source modules in Drupal.</p>
<p>Technical writers have spent the last 100 years or so figuring out ways to improve the way they write and manage product documentation. Along the way they've developed a series of methodologies that make it possible to reuse documentation across publications and to save money on translation costs.</p>
<p>Mobile is making content reuse a mainstream concern. Learn how we can use adaptive content and methodologies from the technical communications world to raise to the occasion.</p>
